Test: ResistantVirus 6

Check that mutProb is applied correctly in the reproduce step.

Your output:

    virus = ResistantVirus(1.0, 0.0, {'drug1':True, 'drug2': True, 'drug3': True, 'drug4': True, 'drug5': True, 'drug6': True}, 0.5)
    Reproducing 10 times by calling virus.reproduce(0, [])
    Checking the resistances of the children to each of the 6 prescriptions.
    Since mutProb = 0.5 and the parent virus was resistant to all 6 drugs, we expect each child to be resistant to, on average, half of the six drugs.
    AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'isResistantTo'

Correct output:

    virus = ResistantVirus(1.0, 0.0, {'drug1':True, 'drug2': True, 'drug3': True, 'drug4': True, 'drug5': True, 'drug6': True}, 0.5)
    Reproducing 10 times by calling virus.reproduce(0, [])
    Checking the resistances of the children to each of the 6 prescriptions.
    Since mutProb = 0.5 and the parent virus was resistant to all 6 drugs, we expect each child to be resistant to, on average, half of the six drugs.
    Test completed.

Test: ResistantVirus 7

Test for positive mutability.

Your output:

    virus = ResistantVirus(1.0, 0.0, {"drug2": True}, 1.0)
    Making 100 successive generations and testing their resistance to drug2
    Fail: virus should reproduce, but got an exception instead.
    AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'isResistantTo'

Correct output:

    virus = ResistantVirus(1.0, 0.0, {"drug2": True}, 1.0)
    Making 100 successive generations and testing their resistance to drug2
    Test completed.

Test: ResistantVirus 8

Test for negative mutability.

Your output:

    virus = ResistantVirus(1.0, 0.0, {"drug1": True}, 0.0)
    Making 100 successive generations and testing their resistance to drug1.
    Fail: virus should reproduce, but got an exception instead.
    AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'isResistantTo'

Correct output:

    virus = ResistantVirus(1.0, 0.0, {"drug1": True}, 0.0)
    Making 100 successive generations and testing their resistance to drug1.
    Test completed.

Test: ResistantVirus 9

Test for virus reproduction with drugs applied.

Output:

    virus = ResistantVirus(0.0, 0.0, {"drug1":True, "drug2":False}, 0.0)
    Test: child = virus.reproduce(0, ["drug2"])
    Test: child = virus.reproduce(0, ["drug1"])
    Test completed.
